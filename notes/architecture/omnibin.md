# omnibin — every nixpkgs binary on your PATH

## What it is

**omnibin** is a FUSE filesystem by Farid Zakaria (fzakaria) that puts
**every binary nixpkgs ever shipped** on your `$PATH`. Nothing is installed,
nothing is built — 0 bytes on disk until something actually reads a file.

```console
$ nix run github:fzakaria/omnibin
omnibin: tree at /run/user/1000/omnibin, cache at /home/you/.cache/omnibin
$ ls /omnibin/bin | wc -l
51468
$ python3 --version
Python 3.14.6
$ python3@3.6.2 --version
Python 3.6.2
```

Over 50,000 top-level binaries on PATH (the tree holds ~880K versioned
`name@version` forms), spanning nixpkgs builds from 2013 to 2026.

## How it works

1. **File listings crawled from cache.nixos.org.** The NixOS binary cache
   has never been garbage-collected — it's an S3 bucket that only grows.
   omnibin indexes the file listings of every store path.
2. **Index built per release.** Each GitHub release ships a prebuilt index
   (`data-pins.json` in the repo pins the tag + hash of every asset; the
   flake fetches them). Recent cut (`data-20260927`): 51,503 executables on
   PATH for `x86_64-linux`, 882,815 `name@version` forms, 30.5 TB of unpacked
   bytes addressable, dates 2012-07-05 to 2026-09-25.
3. **FUSE + lazy fetch.** Mount the FUSE filesystem; binaries resolve on
   demand and are fetched from the binary cache only when read. The shell
   app (`nix run github:fzakaria/omnibin`) drops you into a shell with the
   whole tree on PATH, backed by an unshare'd mount namespace.

## How we use it here (no FUSE)

FUSE is impossible in this sandbox (see [capabilities.md](capabilities.md):
kernel has FUSE, but `mknod` is denied so `/dev/fuse` can't be created).
So we use omnibin **nix-native, no FUSE**:

```bash
# Query the pinned index DB — no mount, no daemon
nix run github:fzakaria/omnibin#omnibin -- which <name>
nix run github:fzakaria/omnibin#omnibin -- which --all <name>   # all versions

# Realise (fetch) any resolved store path and run it
nix-store --realise <store-path>
```

Always run with the taint shim:
`LD_PRELOAD=~/tools/taint-shim/taint_shim.so` (the `/usr/local/bin/nix`
wrapper does this automatically).

### Zero-step `@version` support

`~/tools/omnibin-not-found.sh` defines `command_not_found_handle`, loaded in
every exec via `BASH_ENV` (the `/bin/bash` wrapper sets it; there is no
`~/.bashrc`). Type any nixpkgs binary and it resolves, fetches, and runs:

```bash
$ cowsay@3.8.4 "hello"     # works with zero per-exec setup
```

Lookup order: nix profile (fast path) → omnibin index (`which --all` for
`@version`) → fallback `nix run nixpkgs#<name>`. Misses still print
`command not found` with exit 127. Verified: `jq`, `python3@3.7.1`
(ran Python 3.7.1 from 2018), `cowsay@3.8.4` (profile), `cowsay@3.8.3`
(index).

At Drewry's direction: no run script, no `~/tools` copy of omnibin itself —
nix-native only, via the flake.

## What doesn't work here

| Feature | Status | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `nix run github:fzakaria/omnibin` shell app | ❌ fails cleanly | Needs FUSE mount; `/dev/fuse` can't be created (`mknod` EPERM) |
| Index query (`#omnibin -- which`) | ✅ works | No FUSE needed |
| `nix-store --realise` + run | ✅ works | Plain store fetch |
| `command_not_found_handle` `@version` | ✅ works | Built on the above |
| Docker image | ❌ n/a | No Docker here; also needs `/dev/fuse` + `SYS_ADMIN` |

Needs the runtime to expose `/dev/fuse` for the full experience.
