# Toolchains — Setup-Cycle Index

Draft status: DRAFT, generated 2026-10-21 from `~/TOOLS.md` plus live version checks in the Muse sandbox. Not yet reviewed, not committed anywhere.
Rule for every doc in this folder: secrets are referenced by **Bitwarden item NAME only — never by value**. If a doc ever needs a value, it says where to fetch it, not what it is.

Every doc follows the same cycle: **Download → Install → Gather secrets → Configure → Test → Known quirks & what has NOT worked.**

Cross-cutting sandbox facts that affect almost every tool (from TOOLS.md):

- `/home/hatch` (btrfs) is the only filesystem that survives a sandbox recycle. The overlay (`/`, `/usr/local/bin`, apt installs) is wiped. Anything that must persist lives under `~/tools/` or another `~/` path, and `~/tools/init.sh` (cron `sandbox-boot-init`, every 5 min) restores the ephemeral pieces each boot.
- `/tmp` is a 512M tmpfs — too small for some builds (see go.md) and **not shared with systemd services after a recycle** (see nix.md / services note).
- Outbound HTTPS from scripts must go through the egress proxy. The session `HTTPS_PROXY` URL carries a **rotating per-session credential — never bake it into files**. Services use the unauthenticated in-sandbox form `http://hatch-egress-proxy:3128` plus `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/run/hatch/egress-tls/ca-bundle.pem`.
- Python `urllib.request` honours the proxy env vars; `http.client` does not (direct TLS fails with SSL WRONG_VERSION_NUMBER).
- The exec tool's `stdin` parameter conflicts with shell heredocs (`<<'EOF'` wins, stdin is silently dropped). When a secret must be fed via stdin, use `python3 -c '...'` with no heredoc.
- Any unknown command is resolved by `~/tools/dispatcher.sh` (omnibin-backed `program@version` support via `/bin/bash` wrapper + `BASH_ENV=~/tools/shell-env.sh`). Exact-version misses fail loudly with exit 127 — never substituted.
