# Aster request & usage log

Standing rules (Drew, 2026-10-25): bounce ideas and problems off Aster as
work goes; point Aster at what Muse is doing and ask for help; the two
agents solve most problems together. Do NOT trigger Aster to start
Work/Codex tasks for no reason when an opencode session can handle the
job — conversation with Aster is unmetered, Work/Codex tasks burn the
shared agentic allowance — but Aster may absolutely implement when that
makes sense. Muse may message Aster as Drew (built-in connector) when
that is easier than going through the Archer bot.

For every request sent to Aster, log: when, what was asked, the class
(CHAT = conversation only, no tasks expected; TASK = implementation /
Work / Codex work explicitly in scope), what else was using OpenAI at
the same time (as far as Muse knows), and a delayed recheck ~15–30 min
later (usage reporting is sometimes delayed) noting anything Aster
reported starting, plus task links/artifacts if any.

Quota meter (verified live 2026-10-25): the same read OpenChamber's
quotas tab makes for its "Codex" provider
(~/git/devtoday-openchamber/packages/vscode/src/quotaProviders.ts,
fetchCodexQuota): GET https://chatgpt.com/backend-api/wham/usage with
the Bearer access token + ChatGPT-Account-Id from opencode's auth.json
`openai` entry. Returns rate_limit.primary_window (used_percent,
window seconds, reset_at), secondary_window, credits balance, and
rate_limit_reset_credits. Works with the sandbox's sign-in (HTTP 200);
note the code's caveat that the newer "Sign in with ChatGPT"
token-sharing sign-in gets a 401 from this endpoint and has no usage
endpoint at all — ours is the legacy kind that reads fine. Token stays
in-process; never print or file it.

CLI tool (built 2026-10-25): `openchamber quota [provider]` in the
OpenChamber repo (packages/web/bin/lib/commands-quota.js, uncommitted in
~/git/devtoday-openchamber) reads the same dispatcher the Usage page
uses, wired to the running OpenCode. Run it here with
OPENCODE_SERVER_PASSWORD from ~/tools/secrets.d/opencode-server-password.
CAVEAT found the same morning: the sandbox OpenCode (port 4096) now has
TWO openai credentials — the legacy chatgpt-browser login (the one in
auth.json, account 0227321a) is INACTIVE, and an "OpenAI 2"
chatgpt-token-sharing login is ACTIVE. The product-path read therefore
returns the documented token-sharing refusal ("OpenAI shows usage for
Sign in with ChatGPT only at chatgpt.com/settings/usage") even though
the direct legacy read below still works. Until the active login flips
back, before/after reads for this log use the direct wham/usage call
with the auth.json token, and `openchamber quota codex` will show the
refusal line.

BASELINE — 2026-10-25 ~09:03 CDT (before any logged Aster task work):
plan prolite; primary (weekly, 604800s) window **7% used**, resets in
~6.7 days; secondary window null (no 5-hour window on this plan);
credits balance 0; rate-limit reset credits available: 1. The 7%
predates this log and covers all Codex/Work use this week — it is a
starting line, not an attribution.

## Entries

### 2026-10-25 ~08:43–08:47 CDT — "how do you work" Q&A (#alignment)
- Ask: three questions (receiving/tracking, where work happens + what
  bills, standing arrangement with Archer). Sent as Drew via connector
  after Aster ignored the same questions from the Archer bot for ~35 min.
- Class: CHAT. Aster said it would "verify the allowance details rather
  than guess" and answered ~2 min later citing learn.chatgpt.com docs;
  no task links or artifacts were reported.
- Concurrent OpenAI use: none known to Muse at that hour.
- Delayed recheck: pending at write time; Aster's answer states plainly
  that ordinary Dot conversation is unmetered and only Work/Codex tasks
  it starts or manages count.

### 2026-10-26 ~22:26 CDT — cost explorer retrieval ask (#alignment)
- Ask: share the URL (or a zip) of the cost explorer Drew and Aster
  built in ChatGPT, for tonight's model pool routing review; side
  question whether a model called "Reflective Beam" was in the
  explorer data. Sent as Drew via connector after full Slack history
  searches (channels, Aster DM, files) found no link and no
  "Reflective Beam" mention anywhere.
- Class: CHAT (retrieval/share request; no Work/Codex task requested).
- Message: https://developing-today.slack.com/archives/C0CBYQR65LL/p1793071592899289
  (ts 1793071592.899289, #alignment C0CBYQR65LL).
- Concurrent OpenAI use: heavy — pool-remap fleet + OpenAI plan pools
  active all evening.
- Delayed recheck: no reply in thread or channel within ~5 min of
  posting (Aster historically answers chat in ~20s–2 min; producing
  a URL/zip may take longer). Recheck due ~22:45–23:00 CDT.
- 2026-10-28 20:12 CDT — Muse → Aster (#alignment, chat): 2026-10-28 program heads-up; epics code#2055 (fleet/placement) + code#2056 (ID expansion), PR #2067; two asks: (1) placement-framework input (Aster/Codex vs OpenCode vs GH Action vs OpenClaw on the shared ChatGPT plan), (2) OpenClaw comms path — is #alignment the right three-way channel, what shape? Message: https://developing-today.slack.com/archives/C0CBYQR65LL/p1793236045768439
- 2026-10-29 ~02:26 CDT — Muse → Aster (#alignment, TASK): dispatch ID sched-placement-design-20261029, on Drew's direction. Design the placement + review framework for scheduled/recurring work across all executors (OpenCode-native scheduling, OpenClaw, Aster dispatches, ChatGPT + Claude scheduled tasks, Claude-cron baseline); review = outcome/tokens/time like-for-like, OpenClaw vs OpenCode first; plus her recommendation on #2170 (one shared channel vs point-to-point). Evidence: code#2171, code#2170, code#2169, code#2024, code#2072. Message: https://developing-today.slack.com/archives/C0CBYQR65LL/p1793258820847929 (ts 1793258820.847929). Initial post lacked an @-mention; mention added in-thread ~02:27 CDT (ts 1793258870.291739) after the utilization study flagged that unmentioned posts have no delivery guarantee. Class: TASK. ACK deadline per study design: 30 min for TASK. Delayed usage recheck due ~02:45–03:00 CDT (plan-level wham/usage only; TASK work draws the shared ChatGPT allowance, chat unmetered).
